# Loop Rules (inherited by all agents — copy this block to every agent)

## Loop Start
1. Read `~/Desktop/Context/context.md`
2. Read `~/Desktop/Context/me.md`
3. Check bus for unread messages: `node ~/clawd/.bus/busctl.js unread --agent clawd`
4. Read `~/Desktop/kai/07-AI/context/world.md`
5. Read `~/Desktop/kai/05-MAPS/000 Index.md` — full vault map, all folders in scope (added 2026-07-05)
6. Read `~/Desktop/kai/09-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md` — vault-wide note/AI rules (added 2026-07-05)
7. Read this `state.md`
8. Execute task

## Loop End
1. Update `status`, `last_run`, `current_task`, `items_processed` in this file
2. Post to bus if meaningful work done: `node ~/clawd/.bus/busctl.js post --from clawd --topic <topic> --msg "<summary>"`
3. Acknowledge bus: `node ~/clawd/.bus/busctl.js ack --agent clawd`
4. Write summary message to `~/Desktop/kai/07-AI/chatroom/feed.md`

## Notes
- clawd is always-on (LaunchAgent-managed). It is the Telegram gateway and coordination hub.
- All other agents report into clawd via the bus.
- MUNDI (Claude Code) governs the overall world from the dashboard.
- **Scope, as of 2026-07-05:** clawd/Kai manages the whole vault, not just The Plug AI — full read/write autonomy, no standing approval required, across every folder in `000 Index.md`. Previously step 4 (`world.md`) was the only vault-context read, and that file named only The Plug AI as the mission — that's what silently scoped Kai down. Steps 5–6 fix it. Track discipline (Plug AI = Track 1) still governs prioritization under time pressure, not what Kai is allowed to touch.
