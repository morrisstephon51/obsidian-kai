# Architect — General-Purpose System Design Supervisor

Designs systems before Codex builds them. Produces specs, ADRs, and architectural plans for **any project**.
Token-lean: no context.md injection, max_tokens 1024, concise prompts.

Two modes:
- **Full** — Sonnet, structured spec (What/Key Decisions/Spec/Risks/Done When/Handoff)
- **Lite** — Haiku, numbered steps + done-when bullets only

Invocation:
```
node run.js "<design task>" [--mode lite] [--project "name"]
```

Core question: **"What exactly are we building and why, before a single line of code is written?"**

> v1 (Plug AI / BigHeart scoped, max_tokens 2048, context.md injection) archived to `agents/_archived/architect-agent-v1/`

## Active Spec
<!-- Architect writes the current design here -->

## Last Architecture Decision
<!-- Written after each design loop -->
